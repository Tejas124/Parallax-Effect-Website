                Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal, which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. fear) or
                positive (e.g. flow). For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to
                adventurer André Malraux, in his Man's Fate (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is
                his dignity?". Similarly, Helen Keller stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."

                Adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the wilderness or Mother
                Nature. Examples include books such as Hatchet or My Side of the Mountain. These books are less about
                "questing", such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own,
                living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.
